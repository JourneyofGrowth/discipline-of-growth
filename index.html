    <h2>Why Only 5% Succeed</h2>
    <p>Most people dream of success, but only a small percentage turn those dreams into reality. Here’s why:</p>
    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. Lack of Clarity:</strong> Without clear goals, it's impossible to focus your energy.<br>
      <em>Question: Do you have a clear vision of what you want to achieve?</em>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. Fear of Failure:</strong> Fear paralyzes most people. The 5% embrace failure as a learning opportunity.<br>
      <em>Question: Are you afraid of failing, so you don’t even try?</em>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. No Consistency:</strong> Success isn’t about big actions; it’s about small, consistent efforts over time.<br>
      <em>Question: Do you give up when results don’t come quickly?</em>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. Fixed Mindset:</strong> Many think they’re not "good enough." The 5% believe they can improve with effort.<br>
      <em>Question: Do you believe your abilities are fixed and unchangeable?</em>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. Lack of Gratitude:</strong> Gratitude keeps you motivated. The 5% celebrate every small win.<br>
      <em>Question: Do you focus only on what you don’t have?</em>
    </div>

    <h2>Your 5-Step Plan to Join the 5%</h2>

    <div class="step">2. Face Your Fears: Identify one fear holding you back and take a small action to overcome it today.</div>
    <div class="step">3. Build Small Habits: Choose a habit that supports your goal and practice it daily for 21 days.</div>
    <div class="step">4. Embrace Challenges: Reflect on a recent setback, what it taught you, and how it made you stronger.</div>
    <div class="step">5. Practice Gratitude: List three things you’re grateful for every morning for a week.</div>
